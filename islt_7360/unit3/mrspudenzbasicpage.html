    <h1>Mrs. Pudenz’s Basic Webpage</h1>
    <h2>About Mrs. Pudenz</h2>
    <p>One of my most important pages I will include in my final project is a space for students and families to learn about their teacher, Mrs. Pudenz. This page will allow students to learn about me before entering the classroom, allowing them to feel more comfortable. Additionally, students and families will learn some personal qualities, including my education and interests, as we prepare to build a relationship for the school year. I will include an image of myself as well.</p>
    
    <p>Example:</p>

    <p>Hello! I am Megan Pudenz and I’m second grade teacher at English Landing Elementary. This is my seventh year as a teacher! This career path was an easy choice, as I’ve known I wanted to be a teacher since I was an elementary student with a pretend classroom in my basement. I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri where I attended the Park Hill School District, who is now my employer. I am a Missouri Tiger at heart, as I am currently working on my third degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia. My degrees are:
        
    <ul>
        <li>Bachelor’s of Science in Elementary Education (2013)</li>
        <li>Master’s of Science in Curriculum and Instruction (2014)</li>
        <li>Education Specialist in Technology in Schools (expected Summer 2020)</li>
    </ul>
                
    <p>My husband and I married in 2014 and welcomed our son, Bennett, in January 2018. Besides spending time with my family, I also enjoy exploring new recipes to cook, refinishing furniture or building new pieces with my husband, and spending time outside. Some of my favorite things include Chipotle, taking a walk, HGTV shows, and decorating. In my classroom, I encourage my students to work hard and respect others. My favorite moments are when a student has a “lightbulb moment” where a concept clicked for them for the first time. Their smiles are contagious!  Our class Mission Statement is:</p>
    
    <blockquote>“The leaders of Room 210 will come prepared to learn and have fun. We work together to listen, help others, show respect, and have positive attitudes.”</blockquote>
    
    <h2>Second Grade Home Learning Resources</h2>
    
    <p>Another page I will include in my final project is a place for students and parents to access home learning, or homework, resources. These resources are listed on a Symbaloo page, used throughout our elementary building, to link sites students are familiar with or will find helpful in learning outside of the school day.</p> 
    
    <p>Example:</p> 
    
    <p>Please use our <a href="https://www.symbaloo.com/mix/2ndgrade17">Second Grade Symbaloo</a> to access helpful tools and resources to support the skills we are working on in class!</p>
