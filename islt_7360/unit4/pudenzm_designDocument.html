  <h1>Mrs. Pudenz's Design Document</h1>

  <h2>Purpose</h2>
  <p>This website will serve as Mrs. Pudenz’s second grade class website. It will be a place that both students and parents will find helpful. Students will be able to use this site to learn about their teacher, practice content being studied in class, learn about upcoming dates, and access resources they will find useful for home learning. Parents will be able to use this site to learn of important events in the classroom, become familiar with their child’s teacher, stay up-to-date on the content we are studying in class, and support their child with home learning. </p>

  <h2>Use Cases</h2>

  <h3>Use Case 1</h3>
  <p>At the beginning of each quarter, new home learning opportunities will be added to my home learning page on my site. Students will be able to access this page by visiting the home page, then clicking on the “Home Learning” tab in the navigation bar. The opportunities will be organized and listed by content or subject area, which connect to the standards we will be studying that specific quarter. Within each subject area, a list of home learning ideas will be provided, while some will include embedded links, which students can click on to access a website directly.</p>

  <h3>Use Case 2</h3>
  <p>A parent would be able to use this individual teacher website to access upcoming dates and events occuring in our classroom that parents and students need to be aware of. These events could include musicals, fundraisers, holiday breaks, early release schedules, and more. This would be customized to second grade and my classroom specifically, rather than a parent referring to a school website and trying to determine which events apply to their child.</p>

  <h3>Use Case 3</h3>
  <p>A parent and student received their postcard in the mail in August with the name of their child’s new second grade teacher, Mrs. Pudenz. The parent and student sit down together to access the English Landing Elementary website and find the link to Mrs. Pudenz’s individual class website. Once on this website, the users are able to click on “About Mrs. Pudenz” in the navigation bar, leading to a biography page about the teacher. On this page, they are able to learn about Mrs. Pudenz’s teaching history and experience, her education, and her interests. They are able to feel more comfortable about the upcoming school year by becoming familiar with her before meeting on Back to School Night.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>

  <b>Individuals Interviews:</b>  3 parents of students, 1 colleague, 1 student
	<p>This audience was interviewed as parents and students will be the primary users of my website, so I need to be mindful of the information they each hope to gain from the site in order to provide them with a place worth visiting. Additionally, I interviewed one teammate or colleague, as I value the feedback provided by an individual in the same field who may be able to provide input that I had not yet considered.</p>

  <b>Would you prefer a grade level or individual teacher website & why?</b>
  <p>3 of the 5 stakeholders preferred a individual teacher website. Reasons included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Information that is important to the grade level will be available on individual site</li>
    <li>Each classroom functions differently and only the specific teacher is needed</li>
    <li>Do not want to be distracted by media applicable to other classrooms, only want to see the students and class my child interacts with</li>
  </ul>

  <b>What information do parents value on a teacher website?</b>
  <p>Responses included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Teacher contact information</li>
    <li>Home Learning opportunities</li>
    <li>Class schedule</li>
    <li>Upcoming events or dates</li>
    <li>Content my student is learning in class</li>
    <li>Lunch menu</li>
    <li>Pictures from class</li>
  </ul>

  <b>What content would be helpful or important to include on a website regarding home learning?</b>
  <p>Responses included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reminder of due dates (each Friday)</li>
    <li>Suggested ideas for opportunities at home</li>
    <li>Links to classroom sites students use</li>
    <li>Links to fun education games</li>
    <li>Access to safe search engines for young students</li>

  <ul>
    <li>Name</li>
    <li>Education background and teaching experience</li>
    <li>Interests and/or hobbies</li>
    <li>Contact information</li>
  </ul>

  <b>How frequently will you utilize this website?</b>
  <p>Four respondents shared that they would visit the site at least once a week. One respondent shared they would visit 1-2 times every other week.</p>

  <h2>Design Concept</h2>

  <h3>Audience:</h3>
  <p>The target audience for Mrs. Pudenz’s individual teacher website is the parents and students of her second grade class at English Landing Elementary. This website would be accessible to these users from home with internet access or in an environment with WIFI capabilities. Additionally, students would find this website useful in the classroom setting to access important links connected to their learning. At Back to School Night, I would provide families with information regarding the class website and provide laptops to demonstrate how to access and use the site if needed.</p>

  <h3>Reference Websites</h3>
  <a href="https://englishlanding.parkhill.k12.mo.us/">https://englishlanding.parkhill.k12.mo.us/</a>
	<p>This site is a good example of a clean palette and organization. A parent (Use Case 1 and 2) would easily be able to navigate the site using the navigation bar at the top. The colors are high contrast between text and background, allowing information to be easily read. The images chosen are used for a specific purpose to grab attention to a specific idea. The user is able to find information about individual teachers through the “Our Staff” link, but must click on several layers to find. This makes it less likely that a user will search for this information.</p>
  <a href="https://www.cpsk12.org/pke">https://www.cpsk12.org/pke</a>
	<p>This site is informative, but cluttered with information on the homepage, making it slightly overwhelming for the user initially. “Our Staff” leads to images of the grade level teachers, but does not provide any information to the user (Use Case 3) about the teacher, which a parent or student will want to know prior to meeting the individual.</p>
  <a href="https://app.oncoursesystems.com/school/webpage/504681/667928">https://app.oncoursesystems.com/school/webpage/504681/667928</a>
	<p>This individual teacher site is simple and provides quality information. However, some links lead to empty pages, which appears unprofessional or unfinished. A parent or student will not value the information if it feels incomplete (Use Case 1, 2, 3). This teacher included a supply list, which I had not considered, but would be worth including in my page on “Important News”.</p>
  <a href="https://jillianstarrteaching.com/about-me/">https://jillianstarrteaching.com/about-me/</a>
	<p>This site is designed as a blog, but its color scheme is similar to my design idea. By this I mean that this website uses a simple white background with black text, allowing the use of color to be reserved for headers or banners and important information. This creates a clean appearance for the users.</p>
  <a href="https://sites.google.com/student.liberty.k12.mo.us/amyfinkle">https://sites.google.com/student.liberty.k12.mo.us/amyfinkle</a>
  <p>This is a Google Site, but it is an example of information that would be important to include in a classroom website. This site provides important dates for parents as users, a page for the teachers biography (Use Case 3), and a space for weekly news (Use Case 2).</p>

  <h2>Presentation of Information</h2>

  <h3>Content Synopsis</h3>
  <p>After receiving feedback through my questionnaire and processing the needs of my classroom, I will move forward by creating a classroom website, rather than one for the entire grade level. The content of my site will include a page for:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>About Mrs. Pudenz: this page will include information about my teaching experience, education background, and personal interests.</li>
    <li>Our Learning: this page will include information that is updated on a quarterly or unit basis regarding the learning standards and explanation of what students are learning in the classroom.</li>
    <li>Second Grade News: this page will include important information about upcoming events taking place at English Landing Elementary and specifically in our classroom, as well as important news that parents need to be aware of.</li>
    <li>Home Learning: This page will outline different options or opportunities for students to select from when deciding what they would like to do for home learning. A list of suggestions will be created connected to learning content and links to supportive sites will be provided.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Text Outline of Website Organization</h3>
  <p>My website will have a home or welcome page, which will be followed with different tabs or pages for each of the following:</p>

  <b>Welcome or Home Page: </b>This page will be used to introduce the user to the site and provide basic details about our classroom.
  <ul>
   <li>Brief welcome statement introducing them to site</li>
   <li>A brief overview of what the user will find on the site</li>
   <li>Link to the elementary page where additional school information can be found</li>
  </ul>

  <b>Additional Pages: </b>The following pages will provide specific and detailed information related to the topic. In an effort to reduce clutter of the page, some items will be in a PDF format. Using a toolbar, the user will be able to access the home page from each additional page to support navigation and reduce confusion.

  <h3>Rationale for Organization</h3>
  <p>I use a color scheme in my classroom, which I will carry into my website for consistency. These colors include teal, red, green, and navy. These colors also hold a connection to the school building. Additionally, a navigation bar will be present at the top of the window to access the home page and additional pages. The user will be able to access the home page from each additional page.</p>
  <h3>Media</h3>
  <p>I will use my personal images from the classroom setting on my website. These images will include students, so long as their family has agreed to the sharing of images. This will also apply to videos, such as musicals or science experiments. Additionally, I will use clip art approved for sharing, but will use it sparingly to support content by drawing attention to important information. If I use media from a different source, I will credit it.</p>
  <h3>Color Scheme and Rationale</h3>
  <p>I have a specific color scheme to my classroom, which I will use to the best of my ability on my website. These colors include teal, red, green, and navy. I will maintain this color scheme to ensure consistency as students are familiar with the design of my room. I will use colors in high contrast between text and background to ensure it is user friendly and can be ready easily.</p>

  <h3>Links to Colors:</h3>
  <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8f8fa">https://www.color-hex.com/color/f8f8fa</a>

  <a href="https://www.color-hex.com/color/ec1148">https://www.color-hex.com/color/ec1148</a>
