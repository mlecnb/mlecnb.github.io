  <h1> Home Learning </h1>

  <h3>What is Home Learning?</h3>
  <p>Home Learning is exactly that--learning at home! The possibilities are endless. On this page, you will find a quarterly Home Learning list, full of ideas that connect to the content being studied in class. You will also find a collection of links to educational websites to visit. The list does not stop there. I encourage your child to get creative. If he/she completes any kind of Home Learning, use the student calendar to sign, or even send a note or email.</p>

  <h3>When is Home Learning collected?</h3>
  <p>Home Learning is checked every Friday morning.</p>

  <h3>Is there a grade or incentive?</h3>
  <p>Home Learning is not reported on our report card, but we teach our students that learning is all around us, regardless of grades. If the student has completed at least 3 Home Learning tasks, they are invited to our weekly Lunch Bunch Celebration in the classroom!</p>
