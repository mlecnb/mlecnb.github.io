  <h1>About Mrs. Pudenz</h1>

  <p>Hello! I am Megan Pudenz and I’m second grade teacher at English Landing Elementary. This is my seventh year as a teacher! This career path was an easy choice, as I’ve known I wanted to be a teacher since I was an elementary student with a pretend classroom in my basement. I grew up in Kansas City, Missouri where I attended the Park Hill School District, who is now my employer. I am a Missouri Tiger at heart, as I am currently working on my third degree from the University of Missouri-Columbia. My degrees are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Bachelor’s of Science in Elementary Education (2013)</li>
    <li>Master’s of Science in Curriculum and Instruction (2014)</li>
    <li>Education Specialist in Technology in Schools (expected Summer 2020)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My husband and I married in 2014 and welcomed our son, Bennett, in January 2018. Besides spending time with my family, I also enjoy exploring new recipes to cook, refinishing furniture or building new pieces with my husband, and spending time outside. Some of my favorite things include Chipotle, taking a walk, HGTV shows, and decorating. In my classroom, I encourage my students to work hard and respect others. My favorite moments are when a student has a “lightbulb moment” where a concept clicked for them for the first time. Their smiles are contagious!  Our class Mission Statement is:</p>

  <blockquote>“The leaders of Room 210 will come prepared to learn and have fun. We work together to listen, help others, show respect, and have positive attitudes.”</blockquote>
