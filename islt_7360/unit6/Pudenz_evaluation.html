  <h1>Evaluation of Mrs. Pudenz's Website</h1>

  <h2>Evaluator Participants:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The evaluator is named Beth. She is a colleague and teaches 2nd grade with me in our elementary building. I selected this evaluator as she has 25 years of experience teaching, allowing her to have a great understanding of what content parents and students need and want access to. As I mentioned, she has been teaching for 25 years at English Landing Elementary. She and I collaborate through our lesson planning, which has helped us create an atmosphere where she feels open to providing honest, supportive, and critical feedback. Beth used a Windows and Google Chrome.</li>
    <li>The evaluator is named Kali. Kali is the mother of one of my second grade students. Kali volunteers in my classroom on a weekly basis and has become very familiar with the happenings of our room. She supports a Use Case because she represent a user (parent) of the site. Kali used Windows and Internet Explorer. </li>
    <li>The evaluator is Leona, a second grade student of mine. Leona is Kali’s daughter. Kali gave me permission to interview Leona for this project. Leona is a female student who enjoys completing Home Learning. Specifically, she is eager to try new web-based tools and finds creative ways to use technology to share her learning. She represents a Use Case because she would potentially use the site as a student. Leona used Windows and Google Chrome.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Summary of Evaluators’ Comments:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Beth found the site to be easy to navigate with nice colors. She believed the homepage could be more organized as the welcome message did not stand out among the rest of the text (specials schedule). She found the text to be in high contrast and easy to read from the background color, but said that some headings or sections did not stand out. Beth found the use cases to be purposeful, as she mentioned that students and parents would return to the site. Beth noticed that the site uses the English Landing logo, but credit is not given, as I am not the original author of this multimedia. She believed this logo needed to be cited or credit given.</li>
    <li>Kali found the headings to be clear but also mentioned that the welcome message and specials schedule were blending together. She suggested finding a way to have the message stand out or seperate the specials schedule.She liked how the Home Learning PDF opened in a new window. Kali noted that this was a pilot site, but felt there was not enough information for parents to be returning uses. She noticed future headings, which could be inviting to these users, but as the site stands now, she felt that information was lacking. She did believe students would return to the site.</li>
    <li>I rephrased the document to be “student friendly language” for Leona’s evaluation. She completed the evaluation with me as she gave me her honest feedback, as manipulating the document was challenging for her. Leona liked the colors of the site and felt it was easy to read. She was not able to find much multimedia other than two pictures. She practiced clicking through the site and observed that she never needed to click more than two times to reach important information. As a student, she reassured that she would return to the site. She, like Beth, also noticed that credit was not given to anyone in regards to the English Landing logo. She wondered if my photo needed to be cited, I reassured her I was the owner of it.</li>

  <h2>Use Cases:</h2>
  <p>Based on the feedback of my three evaluators, who each represent a use case, I am confident that my site successfully supports their use. The purpose of my site is to provide information to parents and students in my classroom on a weekly, quarterly, and yearly basis. Parents are able to use the pilot site to access information about Mrs. Pudenz, their child’s teacher, and to understand the expectations of Home Learning. Students are currently able to use the site to access information and links to support Home Learning. By the final website, parents will be able to return to the site for a weekly update on the events and news happening in the classroom and the content students are studying. All of the users were able to access the site, so I do not feel like I need to abandon use cases at this time. My evaluators made suggestions for improvements, but each had positive things to say about it.</p>

  <h2>Recommended/Planned Changes to Design:</h2>
  <p>Some changes need to be made to my site. Two evaluators (Beth and Kali) observed disorganization on the home page, as the message did not stand out. As this is the first page a user will use, they felt it was important to have this message stand out to the user. I could change the color of the font and place a heading above stating “Welcome!” Additionally, I can make this heading larger than the heading of the specials schedule, as this information is important but does not need to stand out as much.</p>
  <p>Several evaluators (Beth and Leona) noted that credit was not given to the English Landing logo. As I am not the original owner of this multimedia, I need to provide credit to the source. This was allow users to feel that my site contains accurate and trustworthy information.</p>
  <p>Lastly, I need to continue developing my two remaining pages, as several users found information to be lacking for parents. The two remaining pages contain information that prioritizes the parent as the user, whereas the pilot site is currently focused more on pages that impact the student. This change will allow all use cases to feel the need and desire to return to the page.</p>

  <h2>Reflection of Evaluation Report</h2>
  <p>I have found it to be very helpful to seek evaluation and feedback from individuals that are directly related to the use cases of my website. This feedback allows me to make changes so the users of my site have the best experience and are encouraged to return. While I hope I make a quality product, my evaluators are able to see my site with fresh ideas and new ideas, allowing me to consider concepts that I had not prior to their review. I learned how to ask quality questions that seek information rather than a yes or no response and to use this data to guide my decision-making as I continue to develop my site. It was useful to seek feedback from a colleague, as she has the background knowledge and experience to determine the information most needed by my use cases. Additionally, I acquired useful information from a parent and a student, which is my target audience. I am glad I included a student because although she is young, she represents a large user-base of my future website, which is who I hope to inspire to keep returning.</p>
